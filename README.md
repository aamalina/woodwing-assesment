Thank you for taking the time to review my assessment.
Below are the steps I considered during the implementation:
1) Create the project using spring-boot framework and using maven.
2) Create API in case I have time to develop a UI for it.
3) Implement an interface for the UI.
4) Create implementation class for the backend logic.
5) Create pojo request and response to make sure that abstraction concept is achieved.
6) Create main class to test the logic.
